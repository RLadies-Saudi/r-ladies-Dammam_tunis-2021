## 1. Welcome

### `r fa("fas fa-rocket", fill = "purple")` What is the tidyverse?

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/tidyverse_hex_sm.png") 
```

From [tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/): "The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures." 

In other words, it's a collection of packages for data reading, wrangling, tidying, and visualization that play nicely together due to their similar design. Click the link above to learn which R packages are included in the tidyverse. 

### `r fa("fas fa-rocket", fill = "purple")` What are we doing today?

In this workshop, we are taking a quick flight into the tidyverse to learn just a few functions that are useful for data wrangling and visualization. 

**Note:** We are visiting the edge of the tidyverse in this workshop. There are *many* other functions and packages to explore on your future missions! See the 'Future missions' section for resources that can help you travel further into the tidyverse.

### `r fa("fas fa-rocket", fill = "purple")` Thank you & citations

Sincere thanks to developers, contributors, maintainers and community members who have created packages in the tidyverse and made so many wonderful resources to help us all learn.

## 2. Data viz in ggplot2

Throughout this workshop, we'll use the `starwars` dataset that exists in the `dplyr` package. Below is a view of the first 5 lines of the dataset (note that you can scroll through the variables (columns) using the arrows in the upper right and left corners of the table).  

```{r, echo = TRUE}
head(starwars, 5)
```

Let's start by making some data visualizations with the `starwars` data! Then we'll continue to build our wrangling & dataviz skills throughout the workshop.

### `r fa("fas fa-user-astronaut", fill = "purple")` Example 1: Meet ggplot

When we make a `ggplot` graph, we need to tell it a minimum of three things: 

- That we're using `ggplot()`
- What data we're going to include
- What type of graph to create using `geom_*`

Let's make a scatterplot graph of **height** versus **mass** for all characters in the `starwars` data. Run the code below by pressing the "Run code" button in the upper right.

```{r ggplot-1, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```

How can we customize our `ggplot` graphs? Let's try a few things!

- Change the point color by adding `color = "purple"` within `geom_point()`, and re-run the code
- Change the theme by adding a new layer with a built-in theme `+ theme_minimal()`
- Change the point color *based on the species variable* by adding `aes(color = species)` within `geom_point()`

<hr>

### `r fa("fas fa-user-astronaut", fill = "purple")` Example 2: A histogram

Not all graph types require an x *and* y axis variable. For example, a histogram only requires one variable (and then the counts are on the other axis). Let's make a histogram of character height from the `starwars` data.

```{r ggplot-2, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Try customizing your histogram above! A few things to try: 

- Update the fill color (`geom_histogram(fill = "orange")`)
- Update the line color (`geom_histogram(color = "blue")`)
- Update the binwidth (`geom_histogram(binwidth = 30)`)
- Update the theme (`+ theme_bw()`)
- Add labels (`+ labs(x = "x axis label", y = "y axis label")`)

<hr>

### `r fa("fas fa-user-astronaut", fill = "purple")` Example 3: A density plot

Now it's your turn to make a density plot (`geom_density()`) from scratch! Like a histogram, this only requires a single variable. In the empty code chunk below:

- Make a density plot of character **mass** from the `starwars` dataset
- Customize by updating the line color, fill color, and theme

If you get stuck, click on the `Hints` button for help. 

```{r ggplot-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r ggplot-3-hint-1}
ggplot(data = _______, aes(x = _______)) +
  geom_density()
```

```{r ggplot-3-hint-2}
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = mass)) +
  geom_density(color = "______", fill = "______") +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r ggplot-3-solution}
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = mass)) +
  geom_density(color = "navy", fill = "cyan4") +
  theme_bw()
```
